Pilates helped peopel to improve their posture and improved my pelvic stability when they couldn’t stand up after surgeries like C-section. Pilates helped people to be mindful of all of their sitting, standing and walking alignments. Our instructors started their Pilates training way before they started teaching it and introducing it in country. Our mentors pushed us to open up Pilates classes in Karachi. We discussed how Asian women need Pilates in our lifestyles and that’s how we introduced it our Trim Gym.
