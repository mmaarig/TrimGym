Rehabilitation:
Exercise and rehabilitation play an integral part in everyoneâ€™s recovery from pain or injury. The primary goals are to help you recover faster, prevent re-injury and develop resilience.  We want to get you back in the game. Rehabilitation exercise aims to bring back full function following injury through restoring muscle strength, endurance, power, and improving flexibility. Our therapists achieve these results by carefully selecting and planning various exercises and drills for each client. Trim Gym trainers are well qualified for Rehabilitation aka Physio Therapy
